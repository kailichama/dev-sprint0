Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer:
1 - imports everything from turtleworld library in swampy package
2 - constructs world 
3 - constructs the turtle bob 
4 - tells the TurtleWorld to wait for the user to do something



These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?

length = interger 

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: 
fd() and rt()

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer:

Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer:

:(


-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer:

Create a loop and add an extra turn step 

def center_circle(t):
    for i in range(5):
        fd(t, 100)
        lt(t)

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: 

Requirement?
